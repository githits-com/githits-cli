# Package Upgrade Review

## Purpose

Dependency-upgrade reviews are a distinct agent workflow. Agents should not infer acceptability from semver, especially for patch updates. The tool surface should make evidence collection cheaper than manually composing `pkg_changelog`, `pkg_vulns`, and `pkg_deps` calls for every package.

`pkg_upgrade_review` is the MCP/CLI-facing tool for this workflow. It answers: "What changed between the currently used version and the target version, and what evidence is available or missing?"

This report reflects the backend schema inspected at `/Users/jpl/.superset/worktrees/af856079-3997-4271-af85-b1901f8a2119/forest-reference/priv/graphql/schema.graphql`.

## Current Schema Fit

The backend now exposes the aggregate query the CLI/MCP tool should call directly:

```graphql
packageUpgradeReview(
  packages: [PackageUpgradeReviewPackageInput!]!
  includeTransitiveSecurity: Boolean
  minSeverity: Float
  changelogLimit: Int
): PackageUpgradeReviewResponse!
```

The CLI/MCP implementation must not fall back to composing `packageSummary`, `packageVulnerabilities`, `packageChangelog`, or `packageDependencies` calls. If the aggregate query is unavailable, surface the backend protocol error. Release should wait until the backend aggregate support is deployed.

Optional evidence is controlled by GraphQL field selection and local query variables:

- `includeTransitiveSecurity` is sent to the backend root field and also controls the selected `security.transitive` subtree.
- `include_dependency_issues` / `--dependency-issues` controls the selected `dependencyIssues @include(...)` subtree. It is not a backend root argument.
- `changelogLimit` caps ordinary changelog entries per package.
- `min_severity` maps to CVSS thresholds and is omitted for `low`, matching the existing upgrade-review request builder behavior.

Out-of-scope evidence remains unchanged: `versionDiff` and runtime/engine compatibility are future enhancements, and the tool must not infer accept/reject recommendations.

## Proposed MCP Tool

Use one tool name for single and batch reviews. The schema accepts either one package (`registry` + `package_name`) or `packages[]`, but not both. This keeps the agent decision simple: use `pkg_upgrade_review` for dependency bump evidence.

```ts
pkg_upgrade_review({
  registry: "npm",
  package_name: "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk",
  current_version: "1.26.0",
  target_version: "1.29.0",
  skip_transitive_security: false,
  include_dependency_issues: true,
  min_severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical",
  format: "text-v1" | "json"
})
```

Batch form:

```ts
pkg_upgrade_review({
  packages: [
    {
      registry: "npm",
      package_name: "zod",
      current_version: "4.3.6",
      target_version: "4.4.3"
    },
    {
      registry: "npm",
      package_name: "lint-staged",
      current_version: "16.2.7",
      target_version: "16.4.0"
    }
  ],
  skip_transitive_security: false,
  include_dependency_issues: true,
  format: "text-v1"
})
```

Validation rules:

- Require either `packages` or the single-package fields.
- Reject `packages` combined with `registry`, `package_name`, `current_version`, or `target_version`.
- Reject tag-style `v` versions for package-addressed registry versions, matching `pkg_vulns`, `pkg_deps`, and `pkg_changelog`.
- Keep transitive security evidence enabled by default because direct-only security hides important dependency-tree evidence. Allow callers to pass `skip_transitive_security: true` when latency is more important than transitive vulnerability context.
- Keep `include_dependency_issues` default `false` initially for the same reason. Turn it on automatically only when the caller explicitly asks for lockfile/dependency-tree evidence, or document that agents should pass it for lockfile reviews.
- Changelog keyword detection scans the full backend range response and keyword-hit entries are surfaced separately so relevant signals are not hidden by the ordinary sample limit. The ordinary non-keyword sample cap is internal; agents should not need to tune it.
- `min_severity` maps to the same CVSS thresholds as `pkg_vulns` (`low=0`, `medium=4`, `high=7`, `critical=9`). It filters direct current/target vulnerability queries and transitive `vulnerabilitySummary(minSeverity:)` aggregates.

CLI shape:

```bash
githits pkg upgrade-review npm:@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.26.0 --to 1.29.0
githits pkg upgrade-review --package npm:zod@4.3.6..4.4.3 --package npm:lint-staged@16.2.7..16.4.0
```

The repeatable `--package` form is the CLI parity path for MCP `packages[]`. Use `..` as the CLI range delimiter because unquoted `>` is shell redirection in zsh/bash. The older `->` delimiter remains accepted when quoted for compatibility. A JSON input file can be added later if repeatable flags are too awkward in real use.

## JSON Shape

The JSON envelope should be data-first and structured for both single and batch output.

```ts
interface UpgradeReviewResponse {
  summary: {
    total: number;
    withUnknowns: number;
    withAddedAdvisories: number;
    withBreakingSignals: number;
    withDirectDependencyChanges: number;
    withTransitiveVulnerabilityAdditions: number;
  };
  reviews: UpgradeReview[];
}

interface UpgradeReview {
  registry: string;
  name: string;
  currentVersion: string;
  targetVersion: string;
  latestVersion?: string;
  versionDelta: "patch" | "minor" | "major" | "prerelease" | "downgrade" | "same" | "unknown";
  security: UpgradeSecurity;
  changelog: UpgradeChangelog;
  compatibility?: UpgradeCompatibility;
  dependencyChanges?: UpgradeDependencyChanges;
  dependencyIssues?: UpgradeDependencyIssues;
  unknowns: string[];
}
```

The summary contains factual counters only. `summary.total` is `reviews.length`; the other counters report evidence categories present in at least one review. The tool does not assign risk levels or make accept/reject recommendations.

Security block:

```ts
interface UpgradeSecurity {
  current: VersionVulnerabilitySummary;
  target: VersionVulnerabilitySummary;
  added: AdvisorySummary[];
  removed: AdvisorySummary[];
  notAddressed: AdvisorySummary[];
  fixed: AdvisorySummary[];
  introduced: AdvisorySummary[];
  unchanged: AdvisorySummary[];
  transitive?: TransitiveSecuritySummary;
}
```

Advisory diffs (`added`, `removed`, `notAddressed`) are now backend-provided. The backend must diff logical advisories over `id ∪ aliases[]`, not raw IDs, or GHSA/RUSTSEC duplicates will be misclassified. The legacy aliases (`introduced`, `fixed`, `unchanged`) remain in JSON for compatibility while the text output uses vulnerability-focused labels: `added`, `fixed`, and `still-present`.

Transitive vulnerability diffs are backend-provided and package/advisory-aware. A dependency version change with the same affected advisory remains `stillAffectedPackageDetails`, not a fixed plus introduced pair. A package can appear in both added and still-affected groups if the target keeps one advisory and adds another. Detail pages preserve backend `totalCount` / `truncated` metadata so JSON and text output do not present capped samples as complete evidence.

```ts
interface TransitiveSecuritySummary {
  currentAffected: number;
  targetAffected: number;
  introducedPackages: string[];
  fixedPackages: string[];
  introducedPackageDetails: TransitiveVulnerablePackage[];
  introducedPackageDetailsTotalCount: number;
  introducedPackageDetailsTruncated: boolean;
  fixedPackageDetails: TransitiveVulnerablePackage[];
  fixedPackageDetailsTotalCount: number;
  fixedPackageDetailsTruncated: boolean;
  stillAffectedPackageDetails: TransitiveVulnerablePackage[];
  stillAffectedPackageDetailsTotalCount: number;
  stillAffectedPackageDetailsTruncated: boolean;
}
```

Version vulnerability summaries should include package-version metadata from `PackageVersionIdentity`:

```ts
interface VersionVulnerabilitySummary {
  version: string;
  publishedAt?: string;
  deprecated?: boolean;
  deprecationReason?: string;
  affectedCount: number;
  nonAffectingCount: number;
  allCount: number;
  advisories: AdvisorySummary[];
}
```

Preserve `deprecated: undefined` when GraphQL returns `null`; only `false` means verified not deprecated.

Changelog block:

```ts
interface UpgradeChangelog {
  source?: "releases" | "changelog_file" | "hexdocs";
  entries: Array<{
    version: string | null;
    publishedAt?: string;
    htmlUrl?: string;
    body?: string;
    bodyPreview?: string;
    headline?: string;
    signals?: string[];
  }>;
  sampledEntries: UpgradeChangelogEntry[];
  keywordEntries: UpgradeChangelogEntry[];
  totalKeywordEntries: number;
  totalEntries: number;
  truncated: boolean;
  breakingSignals: string[];
  migrationSignals: string[];
}
```

When backend `PackageChangelogResult.source` is `null`, render this as package-version fallback in text but keep JSON source omitted and set `fallback: "package_versions"` or equivalent explicit metadata if needed. Body-less entries are not release-note evidence and must be reported as missing evidence.

Compatibility block:

```ts
interface UpgradeCompatibility {
  peerDependencyChanges: string[];
  notes: string[];
}
```

Direct package deprecations can be populated from `PackageVersionIdentity.deprecated` / `deprecationReason`. Runtime engines are not exposed by the current schema; do not add an `engines` field in v1. Peer dependency changes can be partially populated from dependency groups today.

Dependency changes block:

```ts
interface UpgradeDependencyChanges {
  direct: UpgradeDependencyChangeGroup;
  transitive: UpgradeDependencyChangeGroup;
}

interface UpgradeDependencyChangeGroup {
  added: UpgradeDependencyChangeItem[];
  removed: UpgradeDependencyChangeItem[];
  changed: UpgradeDependencyChangeItem[];
}
```

Dependency changes are backend-provided by the aggregate upgrade-review response. Direct dependency set or constraint changes are reported as facts because they alter install behavior even when direct vulnerabilities and changelog checks are clean. Transitive dependency graph changes are rendered for context. The backend excludes the target/current root package node and synthetic nodes from transitive change rows.

## Text Shape

Default `text-v1` should be compact and evidence-first, but it must include concrete samples rather than only counters. Changelog text should show source/count/truncation and all keyword-hit entries in the reviewed range. If there are no keyword hits, show a small deterministic sample of ordinary entries. `--verbose` expands non-keyword rows from the current response, but changelog bodies still render filtered excerpts/headline paragraphs to avoid commit-list dumps.

```text
pkg_upgrade_review | 2 upgrades | unknowns=1 added-vulns=0 change-keywords=0 dependency-changes=1 transitive-vuln-additions=0

npm:@modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.26.0 -> 1.29.0 | minor
vulnerabilities
  direct package advisories: current version affected=0, target version affected=0, fixed by target=0, added in target=0, still affects target=0
changes
  source: releases
  release entries: 3 total, 3 with release-note bodies
  keyword hits: 1 entries (removed); heuristic text match
  keyword hit entries:
    - 1.29.0
      [removed]: Removed deprecated transport helpers...
dependencies
  direct dependencies: added=1, removed=0, changed=2
  direct changed:
    - zod ^3.25.0 -> ^4.0.0
    - eventsource ^3.0.0 -> ^4.0.0

npm:zod 4.3.6 -> 4.4.3 | patch
vulnerabilities
  direct package advisories: current version affected=0, target version affected=0, fixed by target=0, added in target=0, still affects target=0
changes
  source: package_versions
  release entries: 2 total, 0 with release-note bodies
unknowns:
  - changelog source has no release-note bodies
```

The text renderer must not say an update is safe or risky. It reports evidence and explicit `unknowns:` only. For every non-empty count, the default text should include representative rows. `--verbose` expands row groups in place instead of forcing agents to reconstruct follow-up commands.

## Fact Reporting Rules

The tool reports facts and missing evidence. It does not assign `low` / `medium` / `high` risk, and it does not decide whether an upgrade should be accepted. The calling agent or human reviewer owns that assessment.

The factual evidence includes:

- Version relationship: major, prerelease, downgrade, same-version, or unknown version shape.
- Target deprecation metadata: verified deprecated, verified not deprecated, or unavailable.
- Direct advisory diff: added, fixed, and still-present vulnerabilities after alias-cluster deduplication.
- Changelog evidence: source, body availability, sampled headline paragraphs, and rudimentary keyword matches clearly labeled as hints.
- Peer dependency metadata changes.
- Direct and transitive dependency graph changes.
- Transitive vulnerability and dependency issue diffs when requested.
- Missing or filtered evidence in `unknowns[]`.

Keyword matching should be lexical and transparent, not hidden model inference. Treat matches only as sampling hints. Start with conservative terms in changelog bodies: `breaking`, `breaks`, `removed`, `drop support`, `migration`, `migrate`, `deprecated`, `renamed`. Avoid broad ecosystem terms such as `node`, `python`, `peer`, `requires`, `config`, or `engine`; real runs showed those produce false positives from CI/config mentions that are not compatibility changes. Handle obvious negations such as `no breaking changes`.

## Current Implementation

The CLI/MCP implementation has one active backend path:

1. `buildPackageUpgradeReviewRequest` validates single-package vs batch mode, normalises registry values to backend enum casing, maps `min_severity` to CVSS thresholds, and keeps `low` unfiltered.
2. `buildPackageUpgradeReview` calls `PackageIntelligenceService.packageUpgradeReview` exactly once with the full package batch.
3. `PackageIntelligenceServiceImpl.packageUpgradeReview` posts the aggregate GraphQL query, validates the typed response with Zod, strips `null` fields to the existing JSON omission convention, and reuses standard package-intelligence transport/auth/error handling.
4. The shared response module normalises backend enum strings to the existing CLI/MCP JSON/text casing (`NPM` -> `npm`, `MAJOR` -> `major`, `HIGH` -> `high`) and preserves the existing terminal formatter shape.

There is deliberately no compatibility fallback to the old client-side fanout. Backend schema mismatch, missing resolver, or deployment skew should surface as the normal package-intelligence backend/protocol error. This prevents the CLI from silently making many backend calls after the aggregate tool exists.

## Implementation Notes For CLI/MCP

- `packages/mcp/src/tools/package-upgrade-review.ts` is the MCP entrypoint.
- `src/commands/pkg/upgrade-review.ts` is the CLI entrypoint.
- `packages/mcp/src/shared/package-upgrade-review-request.ts` owns validation and backend param construction.
- `packages/mcp/src/shared/package-upgrade-review-response.ts` owns backend response normalisation and text/JSON formatting.
- `packages/core-internal/src/services/package-intelligence-service.ts` owns the aggregate GraphQL query and typed service method.
- Parity tests assert CLI `--json` and MCP `format:"json"` equality for single, batch, backend unknown-evidence, and validation-error paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

- MCP `pkg_upgrade_review` and CLI `githits pkg upgrade-review` expose equivalent JSON envelopes for single-package and repeatable-package batch input.
- The tool calls the aggregate backend `packageUpgradeReview` operation once per request.
- The tool has no fallback to `packageSummary`, `packageVulnerabilities`, `packageChangelog`, `packageDependencies`, or the old upgrade dependency probe.
- The tool never returns risk levels. It reports vulnerability, changelog, compatibility, dependency-change, dependency-issue, and unknown evidence as facts.
- Backend enum casing is normalised to the existing public JSON/text contract.
- Transitive security defaults on and can be disabled with `skip_transitive_security` / `--no-transitive-security`; `include_dependency_issues` selects the backend `dependencyIssues` subtree only when requested.
- Release waits until the backend aggregate resolver is deployed to production; smoke suites fail with a backend protocol mismatch before that deployment.

## Resolved Decisions

- `packages[]` is part of `pkg_upgrade_review` v1 because batch upgrade review is the core agent UX problem.
- Transitive security evidence defaults on so vulnerability output includes dependency-tree evidence by default.
- `include_dependency_issues` is a separate flag and defaults to `false`.
- Direct/transitive dependency-change diffs are backend-provided and rendered as facts.
- `versionDiff` remains deferred until a dedicated typed service/error surface exists.
- Text mode shows compact summaries by default. `--verbose` / `verbose: true` adds dependency-change examples, including transitive version changes.
- Runtime/engine compatibility is not asserted because no stable backend field exists. Lexical changelog signals are reported only as sampled evidence hints unless later verified by schema data.
